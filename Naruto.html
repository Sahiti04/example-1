            <h1> Naruto Uzumaki
                <p> Naruto is a kid of Konohagakure, the hidden village of leaves. He doesn't know about his parents. He had
                a nine tailed demon fox, Kyuubi sealed in him. The citizens of the village were scared of the fox and 
                they started to distance their kids from him. Due to this, Naruto had no friends. He was always lonely.
                The third hokage, Hiruzen Sarutobi, took care of Naruto. He was acknowledged by his teacher in the ninja 
                academy, Iruka. Iruka used to treat him to ramen all the time. His favourite was the ramen from a place 
                called Ichiraku Ramen. He basically used to live on ramen.</p> 
            </h1>
            <h2> Team 7 
               <p>It was time for Naruto to graduate from the Ninja Academy. He does hardwork and it pays off. He successfully 
                graduates from the academy becoming a Genin level ninja. The people graduated from the academy are divided into
                teams with a Jonin level ninja as their leader. The teams were, Inuzuka Kiba, Aburame Shino, Hyuga Hinata and 
                their leader was Kurenai. The next team was Shikamaru Nara, Ino Yamanaka, Chouji Akimichi and their leader was 
                Asuma sarutobi. The next team were Rock Lee, Tenten, Hyuga Neji and their leader was Maito Gai. The last team is 
                Team 7 comprising, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno and their leader is Kakashi Hatake.</p>
            </h2>
            <h3> Teamwork comes first!
                <p>The first test Team 7 faces is testing their teamwork. They had to take bells from Kakashi, for which they could
                use force. At first they attack recklessly. After all take hits, Kakashi explains them the concept of teamwork. 
                After a point of time Naruto starts getting hungry and tries to eat lunch and is punished for doing so. The others eat 
                in front of him and he is tied to a log. After Kakashi goes away, Sasuke offers Naruto lunch. Sasuke and Sakura share 
                their lunch with Naruto which shows their teamwork. Kakashi appears suddenly and tells them that they have passed the 
                test. They are happy to know that they will start their missions from the next day.</p>
